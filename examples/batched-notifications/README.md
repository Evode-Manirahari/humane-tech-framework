# Batched Notifications Example

This example demonstrates implementing the "Batched Notifications" pattern from our [Design Patterns](../../docs/design-patterns.md) collection. The pattern helps respect user attention by grouping non-urgent notifications and delivering them at scheduled intervals.

## Implementation Overview

This example includes:

1. A notification categorization system
2. User-configurable delivery schedules
3. Priority classification for urgent vs. non-urgent notifications
4. Batching logic and delivery mechanism

## Technologies

The example is implemented in:
- JavaScript (React Native for mobile)
- JavaScript (React for web)

## Files Explained

- `NotificationService.js` - Core service for notification handling
- `NotificationBatcher.js` - Logic for batching and scheduling notifications
- `UserPreferences.js` - User-configurable settings
- `PriorityClassifier.js` - Algorithm for determining notification urgency
- `NotificationDisplay.js` - UI components for displaying notifications

## Key Humane Design Elements

### Respects User Attention
- Non-urgent notifications don't interrupt users immediately
- Users receive fewer, more meaningful notification sessions
- Important notifications can still come through immediately

### Provides User Control
- Users can customize batching frequency
- Users can set quiet hours and active hours
- Users can override categories for specific senders or topics

### Transparent Operation
- Clear indicators of when batches will be delivered
- Explanations of how priority is determined
- Preview of next batch content available on demand

## How to Use This Example

1. Review the code to understand the implementation
2. Adapt the concepts to your platform and technology stack
3. Consider your specific use case and adjust the priority classification accordingly
4. Test with users to find the optimal batching frequency
