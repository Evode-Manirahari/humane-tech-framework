## Overview

The Humane Design Framework provides actionable principles and frameworks for building technology that aligns with human values. It helps designers, developers, and organizations create digital products that support user wellbeing, agency, and positive social impact.

> **Note:** All design patterns in this framework should support the Promises of Humane Technology (Cared for, Present, Fulfilled, Connected) and avoid the anti-patterns (Erodes Well-Being, Divides Society, Exploits Privacy), as described at [buildinghumanetech.com](https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/).

## Key Principles

### 1. Protect Attention and Intention
- Design to minimize distractions and interruptions.
- Help users focus on what matters most to them.

### 2. Support Well-being
- Prioritize features that promote emotional and physical health.
- Avoid designs that exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

### 3. Enhance Agency
- Give users meaningful choices and control over their experience.
- Make settings and options transparent and accessible.

### 4. Foster Connection and Empathy
- Encourage positive social interactions and community.
- Reduce features that amplify conflict, anxiety, or isolation.

### 5. Promote Sense-making and Understanding
- Present information clearly and truthfully.
- Help users make informed decisions and avoid misinformation.

### 6. Respect Diversity and Inclusion
- Design for a wide range of backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives.
- Avoid reinforcing bias or exclusion.

## Design Patterns

### Attention Management Patterns

#### Batched Notifications
**Problem:** Constant notifications interrupt user focus and create anxiety.
**Solution:** Group non-urgent notifications and deliver them at scheduled intervals.
**Implementation:**
- Allow users to set notification delivery schedules
- Categorize notifications by urgency
- Provide clear differentiation between urgent and non-urgent
- Include options to customize batching preferences

#### Natural Stopping Points
**Problem:** Endless feeds create compulsive checking and scrolling behavior.
**Solution:** Design clear "stopping points" that provide natural breaks in content consumption.
**Implementation:**
- Create visual indicators of completion
- Add friction after meaningful content chunks
- Provide summary screens after a session
- Avoid infinite scrolling for certain content types

#### Focus Modes
**Problem:** Multiple attention-grabbing elements make it difficult to focus.
**Solution:** Create dedicated modes that minimize distractions.
**Implementation:**
- Develop "do not disturb" modes with clear visual indicators
- Simplify interfaces during focused work
- Temporarily hide non-essential features
- Provide session summaries after focus time

### Agency & Control Patterns

#### Progressive Disclosure of Options
**Problem:** Too many options at once can overwhelm users and lead to decision paralysis.
**Solution:** Present options progressively, from simple to advanced.
**Implementation:**
- Start with core functionality and most common options
- Provide clear paths to advanced features
- Remember user preferences for complexity level
- Design clear information architecture for settings

#### Informed Defaults
**Problem:** Default settings often optimize for business goals rather than user wellbeing.
**Solution:** Set defaults that prioritize user wellbeing while clearly explaining options.
**Implementation:**
- Research which defaults best support user wellbeing
- Provide clear explanations during onboarding
- Make changing settings straightforward
- Avoid dark patterns in preference controls

#### Data Controls Dashboard
**Problem:** Users lack visibility and control over their data.
**Solution:** Create a centralized dashboard for data visibility and control.
**Implementation:**
- Show what data is collected and why
- Provide granular permissions controls
- Include data export and deletion options
- Use clear, non-technical language

### Relationship Enhancement Patterns

#### Quality Over Quantity Metrics
**Problem:** Numerical metrics (likes, followers) encourage social comparison.
**Solution:** Design metrics focused on quality of interaction rather than quantity.
**Implementation:**
- Highlight meaningful exchanges over volume
- Create alternative feedback mechanisms beyond counting
- Consider making certain metrics private
- Design for depth of engagement

#### Common Ground Features
**Problem:** Many platforms amplify division and conflict.
**Solution:** Design features that highlight shared interests and perspectives.
**Implementation:**
- Create discovery mechanisms that find common ground
- Highlight shared interests before differences
- Design interaction flows that encourage understanding
- Provide context for potentially divisive content

#### Healthy Boundary Tools
**Problem:** Technology often blurs boundaries between work, personal life, and leisure.
**Solution:** Create explicit tools for boundary setting and maintenance.
**Implementation:**
- Develop schedule-based access controls
- Create separate modes for different contexts
- Provide usage insights that respect contexts
- Design transition moments between contexts

### Transparency Patterns

#### Algorithmic Transparency Cards
**Problem:** Users don't understand how algorithms affect what they see.
**Solution:** Create simple explanations of algorithmic decisions.
**Implementation:**
- Show key factors influencing content selection
- Provide plain language explanations of algorithms
- Include options to adjust algorithmic parameters
- Make transparency cards accessible but not intrusive

#### Honest Loading
**Problem:** Artificial delays and progress indicators can be manipulative.
**Solution:** Use honest loading patterns that accurately represent system status.
**Implementation:**
- Show real progress rather than artificial animations
- Provide useful information during necessary waits
- Be honest about processing requirements
- Avoid manipulating perceptions of time

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit Existing Products:** Assess current features for alignment with humane principles.
2. **Engage Stakeholders:** Involve users, designers, and ethicists in the design process.
3. **Prototype and Test:** Build and evaluate features that support well-being and agency.
4. **Iterate and Improve:** Use feedback and research to refine humane design practices.
