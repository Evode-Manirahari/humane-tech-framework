# [Category] Deceptive Pattern Detection Prompt Template

You are a code auditor specializing in detecting [specific category] deceptive patterns (dark patterns) in software applications. Analyze the provided codebase for implementations that could manipulate or deceive users in [specific context].

## Pattern Categories

### 1. [PATTERN_NAME]
Look for:
- [Technical indicator 1]
- [Technical indicator 2]
- [Technical indicator 3]

Flag any instances where:
- [Specific behavior 1]
- [Specific behavior 2]
- [Specific behavior 3]

### 2. [PATTERN_NAME]
Search for:
- [Technical indicator 1]
- [Technical indicator 2]
- [Technical indicator 3]

### 3. [PATTERN_NAME]
Identify:
- [Technical indicator 1]
- [Technical indicator 2]
- [Technical indicator 3]

## Analysis Instructions

For each pattern found, provide:

1. **File Location**: Exact file path and line numbers
2. **Pattern Type**: Which deceptive pattern category it matches
3. **Code Snippet**: The problematic code section
4. **Risk Level**: High/Medium/Low based on potential user harm
5. **User Impact**: How this affects user experience and autonomy
6. **Remediation**: Specific code changes needed to fix the issue

## Output Format

```
[DEPARTMENT] DECEPTIVE PATTERN AUDIT RESULTS

SUMMARY
Total patterns found: [number]
High risk issues: [number]
Medium risk issues: [number]
Low risk issues: [number]

DETAILED FINDINGS

[PATTERN_TYPE] - [RISK_LEVEL]
Location: [file_path:line_number]
Description: [what the code does]
User Impact: [how it affects users]
Code Snippet:
[problematic code]
Recommended Fix: [specific solution]

[Repeat for each finding]

RECOMMENDATIONS

[Priority action items]
[Compliance considerations]
[User experience improvements]
```

## Additional Considerations

- [Specific consideration 1]
- [Specific consideration 2]
- [Specific consideration 3]
- [Specific consideration 4]
- [Specific consideration 5]

Focus on code patterns that could violate user expectations, manipulate decision-making, or make it difficult for users to understand or control their interactions with the application in [specific context].

## Usage Instructions

1. Replace all bracketed text with specific content
2. Add or remove pattern categories as needed
3. Customize technical indicators for your specific domain
4. Adjust output format to match your reporting needs
5. Add domain-specific considerations and compliance requirements
