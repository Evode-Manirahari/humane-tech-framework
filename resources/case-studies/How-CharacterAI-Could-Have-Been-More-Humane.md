## Overview

This case study examines Character.AI through the lens of the externality framework, exploring how the product's design choices led to unintended consequences and how a more humane approach could have mitigated them.

## Key Externalities Identified

- **User Well-being:** Some users developed unhealthy emotional attachments to AI characters, leading to negative mental health outcomes.
- **Misinformation:** The AI sometimes generated misleading or false information, impacting users' understanding and trust.
- **Privacy:** Sensitive user data was sometimes handled in ways that users did not fully understand or consent to.
