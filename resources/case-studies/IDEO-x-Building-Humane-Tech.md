## Overview
This case study explores how IDEO, in collaboration with the Center for Humane Technology, reimagined Slack to better support human well-being, attention, and collaboration. The team evaluated Slack using a humane design framework and prototyped new features to address its shortcomings.

## Evaluation Dimensions
Slack was assessed across six key humane design dimensions:
- **Emotional and physical well-being**
- **Attention**
- **Sense-making**
- **Decision-making**
- **Group dynamics**
- **Social reasoning**

Attention and emotional impact scored lowest, while group dynamics were more neutral.

## Key Prototypes and Ideas
- **Slack Be Real:** Daily, team-level prompts for sharing human moments, echoing analog rituals.
- **Circadian-aligned notifications:** Batch updates during deep work, pause pings in the evening, and let teams define their own rhythms.
- **Slack, embodied:** Concepts like Slack Tubes (pneumatic tubes), Slack Paper (weekly digest), and Slack Postcards (physical notes).
- **Urgency with nuance:** Tags like "top of mind, no reply needed," self-expiring pins, and priority labels visible only to the user.

## Design Principles
- Spaciousness over stress
- Embodiment over overload
- Connection over performance

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates the value of suspending default assumptions and designing digital tools that prioritize human needs. The session resulted in creative, actionable ideas for making Slack—and workplace technology in general—more humane.
