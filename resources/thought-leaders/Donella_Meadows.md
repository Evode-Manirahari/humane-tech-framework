# Donella Meadows: Leverage Points – Places to Intervene in a System

Donella Meadows was a pioneering systems thinker whose work is foundational to the field of systems change and humane technology. Her essay, "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System," offers valuable insights into how we can effectively change complex systems.

## The Twelve Leverage Points

Meadows identified leverage points as places within a complex system where a small shift can produce big changes. She ranked these points from least to most effective for creating systemic change:

### In increasing order of effectiveness:

12. **Constants, parameters, numbers** (subsidies, taxes, standards)
11. **The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks**, relative to their flows
10. **The structure of material stocks and flows** (transport networks, population age structures)
9. **The lengths of delays**, relative to the rate of system change
8. **The strength of negative feedback loops**, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against
7. **The gain around driving positive feedback loops**
6. **The structure of information flows** (who does and does not have access to information)
5. **The rules of the system** (incentives, punishments, constraints)
4. **The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure**
3. **The goals of the system**
2. **The mindset or paradigm** out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises
1. **The power to transcend paradigms**

## Key Insights

Meadows noted that leverage points are often counterintuitive. As she explained:

> "People know intuitively where leverage points are. Time after time I've done an analysis of a company, and I've figured out a leverage point... Then I've gone to the company and discovered that there's already a lot of attention to that point. Everyone is trying very hard to push it IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!"

Other important insights include:

- The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it
- Paradigms are the sources of systems, and changing them can transform everything
- The most effective intervention is to remain unattached to any paradigm, recognizing that no single worldview is "true"

## Applications to Humane Technology

Meadows' framework is particularly relevant to creating humane technology:

- **Parameters (#12)**: Privacy settings, notification limits
- **Information Flows (#6)**: Transparency in algorithms, data access
- **Rules (#5)**: Design standards, ethical guidelines
- **Goals (#3)**: Shifting from engagement metrics to well-being metrics
- **Paradigms (#2)**: Moving from "technology is neutral" to "technology embodies values"

By understanding these leverage points, designers and developers can make more intentional choices about where and how to intervene in technological systems to create more humane outcomes.
