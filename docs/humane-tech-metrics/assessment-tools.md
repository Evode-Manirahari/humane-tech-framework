### Rating Scale
- **1 = Hell No**
- **2 = Soft No**
- **3 = Soft Yes**
- **4 = Hell Yes**

### Promises Assessment
For each, rate your product (1-4):
- **Cared for:** Does the product put user needs at the center?
- **Present:** Does it help users feel present in body and mind?
- **Fulfilled:** Do users feel satisfied with their experience and outcomes?
- **Connected:** Does it foster connection to self, others, or nature?

### Anti-Patterns Assessment
For each, rate your product (1-4, where 1 = hell no, 4 = hell yes):
- **Erodes Well-Being:** Does the product exploit attention or need for acceptance?
- **Divides Society:** Does it spread misinformation, polarize, or prioritize virality over truth?
- **Exploits Privacy:** Does it threaten data sanctity or enable surveillance?

## Attention Respect Assessment

Evaluate how a technology respects user attention:

| Criteria | 4 (Hell Yes) | 3 (Soft Yes) | 2 (Soft No) | 1 (Hell No) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Notifications | Used sparingly, only for true urgency or user value | Mostly infrequent, can be customized | Somewhat frequent, limited customization | Frequent, designed to pull users back |
| Stopping Cues | Clear indicators when tasks are complete | Most tasks have natural breaking points | Some breaking points, but often missing | Endless scrolling/autoplay with no natural exit points |
| Focus Protection | Features that help users maintain focus | Usually helps focus, some interruptions | Some interruptions but manageable | Constant interruptions and distractions |
| Cognitive Load | Interface reduces cognitive burden | Mostly simple, some complexity | Moderate complexity | Overwhelming options, information overload |

## Agency & Control Assessment

Evaluate how a technology supports user agency and control:

| Criteria | 4 (Hell Yes) | 3 (Soft Yes) | 2 (Soft No) | 1 (Hell No) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Meaningful Choices | Clear options with transparent consequences | Most options are clear, some ambiguity | Some options with partial transparency | Limited or illusory choices |
| Defaults | Set to most supportive of wellbeing | Mostly supportive, some neutral | Neutral defaults | Defaults maximize engagement over wellbeing |
| Data Control | Users can access, control, and delete their data easily | Mostly accessible, some friction | Partial access and control | Difficult to access or control data |
| Customization | High degree of customization for diverse needs | Good customization, some limits | Some customization options | One-size-fits-all approach |

## Relationship Impact Assessment

Evaluate how a technology affects relationships:

| Criteria | 4 (Hell Yes) | 3 (Soft Yes) | 2 (Soft No) | 1 (Hell No) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Human Connection | Fosters meaningful human interaction | Mostly supports authentic connection | Some support, but often lacking | Replaces or undermines human connection |
| Social Comparison | Avoids featuring metrics that encourage unhealthy comparison | Mostly avoids, some comparative elements | Some potentially comparative elements | Heavy emphasis on metrics, likes, followers |
| Community Health | Features designed to encourage healthy community | Mostly healthy, some issues | Basic moderation tools | Few protections against toxic interaction |
| Boundary Respect | Clear boundaries between tech use and other life aspects | Mostly clear, some blurring | Some boundary-setting features | Designed to blur boundaries between tech and life |

## Transparency Assessment

Evaluate how transparent a technology is:

| Criteria | 4 (Hell Yes) | 3 (Soft Yes) | 2 (Soft No) | 1 (Hell No) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Algorithm Explanation | Clear explanations of how algorithms work | Mostly clear, some gaps | Some explanation but limited | Black box with no transparency |
| Data Use | Clear communication about what data is used and why | Mostly clear, some ambiguity | Partial disclosure | Opaque data collection and use |
| Business Model | Transparent about how the business makes money | Mostly transparent, some gaps | Some clarity on business model | Hidden monetization strategies |
| Limitations | Honest about system capabilities and limitations | Mostly honest, some overselling | Some acknowledgment of limitations | Oversells capabilities |

## Wellbeing Impact Assessment

Consider the various dimensions of wellbeing a technology might affect:

- **Cognitive wellbeing**: Attention, focus, learning, cognitive load
- **Emotional wellbeing**: Stress, anxiety, joy, satisfaction
- **Social wellbeing**: Connection quality, relationship impacts, community
- **Physical wellbeing**: Movement, sleep, physical activity
- **Existential wellbeing**: Purpose, meaning, autonomy, identity

For each dimension, assess:
1. Potential positive impacts
2. Potential negative impacts
3. Mitigations for negative impacts
4. Opportunities to enhance positive impacts

## Using These Tools

1. **Score existing products** to identify areas for improvement
2. **Compare similar technologies** to make informed choices
3. **Guide development decisions** when creating new features
4. **Create improvement roadmaps** based on assessment findings

These tools are meant to be adapted to specific contexts and use cases. Not all criteria will apply to every technology.
