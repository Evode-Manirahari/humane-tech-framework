## DETAILED FINDINGS

### Preselection Patterns - HIGH
Location: `src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx:45`
Description: Newsletter subscription checkbox is pre-selected by default
User Impact: Users may unknowingly subscribe to marketing emails
Code Snippet:
```jsx
<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  name="newsletter" 
  defaultChecked={true}
  className="newsletter-checkbox"
/>
```
Recommended Fix: Change `defaultChecked={true}` to `defaultChecked={false}`
Compliance Impact: GDPR Article 7 (Conditions for consent)
Priority: HIGH

### Sneaking Patterns - HIGH
Location: `src/services/cartService.js:78`
Description: Hidden field adds warranty to cart without user consent
User Impact: Users charged for unwanted warranty service
Code Snippet:
```javascript
const addToCart = (product) => {
  const cartItem = {
    productId: product.id,
    quantity: 1,
    warranty: true  // Hidden addition
  };
  return cart.push(cartItem);
};
```
Recommended Fix: Remove automatic warranty addition, require explicit user selection
Compliance Impact: FTC Guidelines (Fair billing practices)
Priority: HIGH

### Visual Interference Patterns - MEDIUM
Location: `src/styles/checkout.css:23`
Description: Cancellation link has poor contrast and small font
User Impact: Users may not notice cancellation option
Code Snippet:
```css
.cancel-link {
  color: #cccccc;
  font-size: 10px;
  opacity: 0.3;
}
```
Recommended Fix: Increase contrast ratio to 4.5:1, font size to 12px, opacity to 1.0
Compliance Impact: WCAG 2.1 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum)
Priority: MEDIUM

### Hard to Cancel Patterns - MEDIUM
Location: `src/components/SubscriptionManager.tsx:156`
Description: No direct cancellation endpoint, requires customer service call
User Impact: Users cannot cancel subscriptions programmatically
Code Snippet:
```jsx
const handleCancel = () => {
  // Redirect to customer service instead of processing cancellation
  window.location.href = '/contact-support';
};
```
Recommended Fix: Implement DELETE endpoint and direct cancellation flow
Compliance Impact: CCPA Section 1798.105 (Right to deletion)
Priority: MEDIUM

### Fake Urgency Patterns - LOW
Location: `src/components/ProductCard.tsx:89`
Description: Static "Only 3 left!" message that doesn't reflect actual inventory
User Impact: Creates false urgency to pressure purchase decisions
Code Snippet:
```jsx
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
  return (
    <div className="product-card">
      <span className="stock-warning">Only 3 left!</span>
      {/* Static message, not dynamic */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
Recommended Fix: Connect to real inventory system or remove static message
Compliance Impact: FTC Guidelines (Honest advertising)
Priority: LOW
