## Overview

This case study explores the externalities associated with rapid growth in technology products, using the externality framework to identify risks and propose mitigation strategies.

## Key Externalities Identified

- **Burnout:** Employees and users may experience stress and burnout due to rapid scaling and increased demands.
- **Quality Decline:** Product quality and user experience can suffer as growth outpaces infrastructure and support.
- **Community Impact:** Growth can disrupt existing communities, leading to loss of trust or negative social dynamics.

## Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder      | Positive Externalities         | Negative Externalities                | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategies                |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Employees        | Career growth, new skills     | Burnout, stress                       | High     | High       | Sustainable growth policies          |
| Users            | New features, better service  | Quality decline, support issues       | Medium   | High       | Incremental rollouts, feedback loops |
| Communities      | Economic opportunity          | Disruption, loss of trust             | High     | Medium     | Community engagement, transparency   |

## Recommendations
