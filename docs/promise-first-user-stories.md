5. **Validate with assessment questions** before finalizing

### Integration with Agile Process
- **Sprint Planning:** Prioritize stories that improve promise scores
- **Refinement:** Use assessment questions during story refinement
- **Development:** Reference promise criteria during implementation
- **Testing:** Include promise validation in acceptance testing
