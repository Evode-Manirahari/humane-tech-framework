# Neil Postman: Questions for Technology

Neil Postman was a renowned media theorist, author, and cultural critic who questioned the role and impact of technology in society. He emphasized thoughtful evaluation of new technologies rather than blind acceptance.

## Key Questions for Evaluating Technology

Postman proposed a set of critical questions to ask about any new technology. These questions help us understand the broader impacts and implications of technological change.

1. **What is the problem to which technology claims to be a solution?**
2. **Whose problem is it?**
3. **What new problems will be created because of solving an old one?**
4. **Which people and institutions will be most harmed?**
5. **What changes in language are being promoted?**
6. **What shifts in economic and political power are likely to result?**
7. **What alternative media might be made from a technology?**

## Relevance to Humane Technology

Postman's questions remain highly relevant to contemporary discussions about humane technology:

- They challenge us to consider the full systemic impact of new technologies
- They ask us to consider who benefits and who bears the costs
- They prompt examination of power dynamics in technological change
- They remind us that technologies reshape culture and language
