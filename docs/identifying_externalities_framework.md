# Identifying Externalities Framework

_Source: [Identifying Externalities Worksheet (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.appolearning.files/production/uploads/uploaded_file/3445572b-9e9f-4d9b-87ac-d7a03465e473/Identifying_Externalities_Worksheet.pdf)_

## Purpose

This framework helps teams systematically identify, analyze, and address the externalities—unintended side effects—of technology products and features. It is designed to prompt critical thinking about who is affected, how, and what can be done to mitigate negative impacts.

## Key Steps

1. **Describe the Product or Feature**
   - What is being built? Who is the intended user?

2. **Identify Stakeholders**
   - Who is directly and indirectly affected (users, non-users, communities, environment, etc.)?

3. **List Potential Externalities**
   - What are the possible positive and negative side effects for each stakeholder group?

4. **Assess Severity and Likelihood**
   - How significant and probable are these externalities?

5. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - What can be done to reduce negative externalities or enhance positive ones?

6. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - How will you track externalities over time and adapt as needed?
