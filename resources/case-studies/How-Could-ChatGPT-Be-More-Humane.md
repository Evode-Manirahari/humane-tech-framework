## Overview
This case study applies the principles of humane technology to ChatGPT, exploring how the top Gen AI app could better nurture humanity, support well-being, and enhance user agency.

## Humane Technology Principles
According to the Center for Humane Technology:
> What if technology treated your _attention_ and _intention_ as sacred? Technology is not neutral; we have a responsibility to do more than “give people what they want.”

## Evaluation Areas
- **Sense-Making:** Ensuring information is clear and verifiable.
- **Decision-Making:** Enhancing user agency and understanding.

## Proposed Features for Humane AI
- **Educational Button:** "Learn more" button to demystify how AI works.
- **Teaching Prompts:** Resources to help users formulate better questions.
- **Help Center:** Assistance for users who need support.
- **Confidence Scale:** Color-coded responses to indicate AI's confidence level.
- **Check Sources:** "Question Mark" button for fact-checking and transparency.

## Broader Recommendations
- **Polycultural AI:** Training data should reflect multiple cultures and perspectives, not just Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) values.
- **Prompting Guidance:** Survey questions to let users choose the type of answers they want.
- **Conversational Experience:** Features like “No assumptions” mode, adaptive communication style, and clear distinction between facts and opinions.
- **User Control:** More control over interaction preferences and data usage.
- **Well-being Focus:** Features that promote user well-being, such as mood tracking or stress-reduction techniques.

## Conclusion
OpenAI and other AI developers have the opportunity to pioneer ethical, humane technology that respects and uplifts users. By integrating these principles, ChatGPT can become a cornerstone of humane AI, strengthening humanity and fostering a more ethical digital future.
