# Humane Tech Linter

> ðŸ“– **New to this tool?** See our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for step-by-step instructions with screenshots!

A CLI tool to scan codebases for deceptive patterns and other anti-patterns that undermine humane technology. This tool helps developers identify and remove manipulative or harmful UX practices from their products.

## Features
- Scans JavaScript, HTML, and other text files for 50+ deceptive patterns
- Reports file, line, and pattern detected
- Easy to extend with new rules
- Includes a web viewer for non-technical users
- **NEW:** Scan any public GitHub repository by just pasting its URL!

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites
- You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.
- You do **not** need to be a developer to use the web viewer, but you do need Node.js and Git to run the linter.

### 2. Scan a Local Folder
- Open a terminal and navigate to the `humane-linter` directory.
- Run the linter on your codebase:
  ```sh
  node index.js <path-to-scan>
  ```
  - Example: `node index.js ../my-project`
- The linter will print results to the console and write a report to `humane-linter-report.json` in the current directory.

### 3. Scan a GitHub Repository (Easiest Way!)
- Copy the URL of any **public** GitHub repository (for example: `https://github.com/ErikaOnFire/humane-tech-framework`).
- In your terminal, run:
  ```sh
  node index.js --github <github-repo-url>
  ```
  - Example: `node index.js --github https://github.com/ErikaOnFire/humane-tech-framework`
- The linter will:
  1. Download the code from GitHub (no need to install or clone anything yourself!)
  2. Scan it for deceptive patterns
  3. Print results to the console
  4. Save a report as `humane-linter-report.json` in your current folder
  5. Clean up after itself automatically

### 4. View Results in the Web Viewer
- Open `web-viewer/index.html` in your web browser (no server or build step needed).
- Click the file input and select your `humane-linter-report.json` file.
- The results will be displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Deceptive Patterns You Could Look For [rules needed]

- Confirmshaming
- Disguised ads
- Misdirection
- Scarcity/urgency manipulation

- Preselected options
- Friend spam
- Fake social proof
- Obscured unsubscribe
- ...and many more

## Note On Current State of Linter
As of June 28th, 2025, we realized that creating a humane linter is invovled to the extent that it would require funding to give it the time and space it deserves, so it has one rule for now (infinite scroll). To develop this concept further, we created a prompts to run on codebases, which you'll find in the deceptive pattern prompts folder
