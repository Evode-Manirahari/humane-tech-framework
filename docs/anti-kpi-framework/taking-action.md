# Taking Action on Anti-KPIs

Anti-KPIs are only valuable if they drive real change. Here’s how individuals, teams, and organizations can use anti-KPIs to create more humane, responsible technology.

---

## 1. Integrate Anti-KPIs into Product Development
- **Pair every major KPI with an anti-KPI:** For each success metric (e.g., engagement, growth), define a corresponding anti-KPI that tracks potential harm (e.g., regret, stress, misinformation).
- **Include anti-KPIs in dashboards:** Make them as visible as traditional KPIs so teams see both sides of impact.
- **Discuss anti-KPIs in planning meetings:** Regularly review both KPIs and anti-KPIs when making product decisions.

## 2. Monitor and Respond
- **Set thresholds and alerts:** Define “yellow” and “red” zones for anti-KPIs. When thresholds are crossed, trigger investigations or interventions.
- **Run regular reviews:** Schedule monthly or quarterly reviews of anti-KPI data to spot trends and emerging risks.
- **Pilot interventions:** When anti-KPIs worsen, experiment with changes (e.g., new features, content warnings, algorithm tweaks) and measure the effect.

## 3. User Research and Feedback
- **Survey users:** Regularly ask about negative experiences, regret, or unintended consequences.
- **User interviews:** Conduct qualitative research to understand the stories behind the numbers.
- **Feedback loops:** Make it easy for users to report harm or negative experiences directly in the product.

## 4. Culture and Communication
- **Share anti-KPI results:** Present anti-KPI data in all-hands meetings, product reviews, and with leadership.
- **Reward teams for reducing harm:** Recognize and incentivize efforts that improve anti-KPIs, not just growth.
- **Educate stakeholders:** Use anti-KPIs to explain the importance of sustainable, humane growth to investors, partners, and team members.

## 5. Policy and Governance
- **Include anti-KPIs in OKRs or performance reviews:** Make them part of how success is measured for teams and leaders.
- **Document response protocols:** Have clear plans for what to do when anti-KPIs cross warning thresholds.
- **External transparency:** Consider publishing anti-KPI data or case studies to build trust and accountability.

## 6. Iterate and Improve
- **Refine metrics:** As you learn, update anti-KPIs to better reflect real-world harm.
- **Benchmark and share:** Compare your anti-KPI performance with industry peers and share best practices.

## Example Actions for Different Roles

- **Product Managers:** Add anti-KPIs to product specs and roadmaps; prioritize features that address negative outcomes.
- **Designers:** Use anti-KPIs to guide user research and stress-test designs for unintended consequences.
- **Engineers:** Build tools to track and surface anti-KPI data; automate detection where possible.
- **Executives:** Set the tone by making anti-KPIs a leadership priority and tying them to company values.
