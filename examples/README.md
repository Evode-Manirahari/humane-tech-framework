## 🎯 Featured Examples

### [Batched Notifications](./batched-notifications/)
**Description**: Implementation of a notification system that batches updates to reduce interruptions and respect user focus time. Demonstrates how to aggregate notifications intelligently and deliver them during appropriate moments.

### [Humane LLM Benchmarking](./benchmark/)
**Description**: A comprehensive toolkit for measuring and evaluating the humaneness of LLM AI assistants, using InspectAI and a database of questions corresponding to different Humane Tech Criteria.

### [Deceptive Patterns Prompts](./deceptive-patterns-prompts/)
**Description**: A collection of prompts to use with AI agents to help identify and eliminate dark patterns in UI codebases. Includes examples of common deceptive patterns and their humane alternatives.

### [Humane Linter](./humane-linter/)
**Description**: A CLI tool to scan codebases for deceptive patterns and other anti-patterns that undermine humane technology. This tool helps developers identify and remove manipulative or harmful UX practices from their products.
