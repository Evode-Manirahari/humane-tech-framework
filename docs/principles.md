### Promises of Humane Technology
When you interact with humane tech, it should make you feel:
- **Cared for:** Your needs are at the center of the experience.
- **Present:** You feel more present in body and mind.
- **Fulfilled:** You are satisfied with your experience and outcomes.
- **Connected:** You connect to yourself, others, or nature.

### What _isn't_ Humane Technology?
Humane technology avoids these anti-patterns:
- **Erodes Well-Being:** Exploits attention span, or need for acceptance & belonging.
- **Divides Society:** Prioritizes virality over truth, spreads misinformation, polarizes.
- **Exploits Privacy:** Threatens the sanctity of data, enables surveillance.

## 1. Respect User Attention

**Technology should respect user attention as a finite, precious resource.**

- Minimize unnecessary interruptions and notifications
- Avoid exploiting psychological vulnerabilities to capture attention
- Design interfaces that help users focus on what matters to them
- Provide clear signals when seeking user attention

## 2. Enable Meaningful Choices

**Technology should empower users with meaningful choices and control.**

- Present genuine choices, not manipulative illusions of choice
- Provide transparent information about consequences of choices
- Make defaults ethical and aligned with user wellbeing
- Allow users to understand and modify how systems make decisions about them

## 3. Enhance Human Capabilities

**Technology should complement and enhance human capabilities, not replace or diminish them.**

- Support human autonomy and decision-making
- Design for collaboration between human intelligence and machine capabilities
- Avoid creating dependencies that diminish human skills
- Foster learning and growth through appropriate challenges

## 4. Protect Dignity and Safety

**Technology should protect human dignity, privacy, and safety.**

- Respect user privacy and secure personal data
- Design systems that protect vulnerable users
- Prevent harassment and abuse
- Avoid manipulative dark patterns that undermine dignity

## 5. Foster Healthy Relationships

**Technology should foster healthy relationships with devices, systems, and other people.**

- Support authentic human connection
- Design interactions that respect appropriate boundaries
- Create systems that encourage empathy and understanding
- Avoid features that exploit social comparison or encourage antisocial behavior

## 6. Prioritize Long-term Wellbeing

**Technology should prioritize long-term user wellbeing over short-term engagement metrics.**

- Consider psychological impacts of design choices
- Resist optimizing solely for engagement or time spent
- Design for sustainable use that enhances quality of life
- Build awareness of how technology affects wellbeing

## 7. Be Transparent and Honest

**Technology should be transparent about its operations and honest about its capabilities.**

- Disclose how systems work and make decisions
- Avoid deceptive interfaces or interactions
- Clearly communicate system limitations and capabilities
- Make algorithms and data use understandable to users

## 8. Design for Equity and Inclusion

**Technology should be accessible and beneficial to diverse populations.**

- Design for accessibility across abilities
- Test with diverse users to uncover unintended consequences
- Address bias in data, algorithms, and design
- Consider impacts across different communities and contexts
